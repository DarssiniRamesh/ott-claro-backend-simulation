# README Update Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the updates made to the README.md file for the OTT Claro Backend Simulation API project. The updates were focused on improving the instructions for starting the project and adding troubleshooting steps for common dependency issues.

## Changes Made

The following sections were added or enhanced in the README.md file:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Added specific version requirements for npm (v6 or higher)
   - Added specific version requirements for MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Added `CACHE_DURATION` variable to the .env file example

3. **Starting the Server**
   - Added a new section with detailed steps for starting the server
   - Added instructions for starting MongoDB on different operating systems
   - Added verification steps to confirm the server is running correctly

4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
   - Added a comprehensive troubleshooting section with solutions for:
     - Module Not Found Errors
     - MongoDB Connection Issues
     - Port Already in Use
     - JWT Authentication Issues

## Rationale

The updates were made to address the following needs:

1. **Improved Clarity**: The original README lacked clear instructions on how to start MongoDB before running the server.

2. **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Users were encountering "Cannot find module" errors and other dependency issues without clear resolution steps.

3. **Platform-Specific Instructions**: Added platform-specific commands for starting MongoDB on different operating systems.

4. **Verification Steps**: Added steps to verify that the server is running correctly after startup.
